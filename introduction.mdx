title: Introduction to SmartGraph
description: "SmartGraph is a Python library designed for building stateful, multi-actor applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a structured and flexible framework to represent complex workflows and interactions between different actors, including human users, AI assistants, and Python functions.

## Why SmartGraph?

Building applications with LLMs often involves managing conversation history, user preferences, and dynamic decision-making. SmartGraph simplifies this process by:

- **Representing your application logic visually and intuitively using a directed graph:** This makes it easier to understand and modify the flow of your application.
- **Handling state management seamlessly:** You can focus on defining the interactions between actors without worrying about the underlying complexities of state persistence.
- **Enabling dynamic branching and conditional logic:** This allows you to create more engaging and responsive applications that adapt to user input and application state.

## Key Features

- **Stateful Interactions:** Maintain and manage state throughout the application lifecycle, enabling persistent conversations and complex workflows.
- **Multi-Actor Architecture:** Define interactions between multiple actors, including human users, AI assistants powered by libraries like `phi`, and custom Python functions.
- **Graph-Based Workflow:** Represent your application logic visually and intuitively using a directed graph, where nodes represent tasks and edges define transitions between them.
- **Conditional Logic and Branching:** Define conditions on edges to control the flow of execution based on data and state, enabling dynamic and responsive applications.
- **Built-in Memory Management:** Leverage short-term and long-term memory components to store and retrieve information, enabling context-aware AI interactions.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Utilize SmartGraph's robust error handling system and comprehensive logging capabilities to debug and monitor your applications effectively.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install SmartGraph using pip:

```bash
pip install smartgraph
```

### Basic Setup

Here's a minimal example to illustrate SmartGraph's core concepts:

```python
from smartgraph import SmartGraph, Node, Edge, HumanActor, AIActor, Task

# Create actors
human = HumanActor("User")
ai = AIActor("AI")

# Define tasks
start_task = Task(description="Start the conversation")
ai_response_task = Task(description="AI provides a response")
human_feedback_task = Task(description="Human provides feedback")

# Create nodes
start_node = Node(id="start", actor=human, task=start_task)
ai_response_node = Node(id="ai_response", actor=ai, task=ai_response_task)
human_feedback_node = Node(id="human_feedback", actor=human, task=human_feedback_task)

# Construct the graph
graph = SmartGraph()
graph.add_node(start_node)
graph.add_node(ai_response_node)
graph.add_node(human_feedback_node)

# Connect nodes with edges
graph.add_edge(Edge(source_id="start", target_id="ai_response"))
graph.add_edge(Edge(source_id="ai_response", target_id="human_feedback"))

# Execute the graph
final_output, should_exit = graph.execute("start", {"user_input": "Hello!"}, "conversation_1")
print("Final output:", final_output)
```
