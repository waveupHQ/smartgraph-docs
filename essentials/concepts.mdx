SmartGraph is built on a few key abstractions that work together to create powerful, flexible LLM applications. Understanding these core concepts is crucial to effectively using SmartGraph.

## ReactiveSmartGraph

The `ReactiveSmartGraph` class is the heart of SmartGraph. It represents the entire application structure and manages the connections between different pipelines and components.

```python
from smartgraph import ReactiveSmartGraph

graph = ReactiveSmartGraph()
```

Think of `ReactiveSmartGraph` as the main application container, similar to how you might think of a React app's root component.

## Pipeline

A `Pipeline` is a sequence of connected components that process data. It's how you organize and structure your data flow within the graph.

```python
pipeline = graph.create_pipeline("MyPipeline")
```

Pipelines in SmartGraph are analogous to the way you might chain methods in a data processing library like Pandas, but with the added power of reactivity and complex branching.

## ReactiveComponent

`ReactiveComponent` is the base class for all components in SmartGraph. It provides the core functionality for processing input data and managing state.

```python
from smartgraph import ReactiveComponent

class MyCustomComponent(ReactiveComponent):
    def process(self, input_data):
        # Process the input data
        return processed_data
```

Components in SmartGraph are similar to React components, but instead of rendering UI, they process data in your AI pipeline.

## Putting It All Together

Here's how these concepts work together:

1. You create a `ReactiveSmartGraph` instance.
2. You add one or more `Pipeline`s to your graph.
3. You add `ReactiveComponent`s to your pipelines.
4. You connect components within and across pipelines as needed.
5. Finally, you compile the graph and execute it.

Here's a simple example:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

```python
from smartgraph import ReactiveSmartGraph
from smartgraph.components import TextInputHandler, CompletionComponent

# Create the graph
graph = ReactiveSmartGraph()

# Create a pipeline
pipeline = graph.create_pipeline("SimpleLLM")

# Add components to the pipeline
pipeline.add_component(TextInputHandler("TextInput"))
pipeline.add_component(CompletionComponent("LLM", model="gpt-4o-mini"))

# Compile the graph
graph.compile()

# Execute the pipeline
result = await graph.execute("SimpleLLM", "Tell me a joke")
print(result)
```

In this example, we create a simple pipeline that takes text input and passes it to an LLM for completion.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the core concepts of SmartGraph, you're ready to dive deeper into how to control the flow of data through your pipelines. Head over to the [Controlling Flow](./pipeline) section to learn more about creating dynamic workflows using pipelines and input handlers.
