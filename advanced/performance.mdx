Optimizing your SmartGraph applications can lead to faster execution times, reduced resource consumption, and improved scalability. This guide covers various techniques and best practices for enhancing the performance of your SmartGraph workflows.

## Asynchronous Execution

SmartGraph is designed to leverage asynchronous programming for improved performance. Ensure you're taking full advantage of this feature:

```python
import asyncio
from smartgraph import SmartGraph

graph = SmartGraph()
# ... configure your graph ...

async def run_graph():
    return await graph.execute("start_node", input_data, "session_1")

final_output, should_exit = asyncio.run(run_graph())
```

## Optimize Node Execution

### Efficient Task Design

Design your tasks to be as efficient as possible:

1. Minimize unnecessary computations within tasks.
2. Use appropriate data structures for faster access and manipulation.
3. Implement caching for frequently accessed data.

Example of a task with caching:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

class CachingActor(BaseActor):
    @lru_cache(maxsize=100)
    async def expensive_computation(self, input_data):
        # Perform expensive computation here
        return result

    async def perform_task(self, task, input_data, state):
        result = await self.expensive_computation(input_data['key'])
        return {"result": result}
```

### Parallel Task Execution (Coming Soon)

In future versions, SmartGraph will support parallel execution of independent tasks.

## Memory Management

Efficient memory management is crucial for performance, especially for long-running workflows.

### Use Short-Term Memory Wisely

Limit the amount of data stored in short-term memory to reduce memory usage:

```python
async def perform_task(self, task, input_data, state):
    # Only store essential data in short-term memory
    await self.memory_manager.update_short_term("key", "value")

    # Use long-term memory for larger or persistent data
    await self.memory_manager.update_long_term("large_data", large_result)
```

### Implement Memory Cleanup

Regularly clean up unnecessary data from memory:

```python
async def cleanup_task(self, task, input_data, state):
    await self.memory_manager.cleanup_long_term_memory()
    return {"status": "cleanup completed"}

cleanup_node = Node(id="cleanup", actor=YourActor(), task=Task(description="Memory cleanup"))
```

## Optimize Graph Structure

### Minimize Unnecessary Nodes

Simplify your graph structure by combining related tasks into single nodes when possible:

```python
# Instead of multiple nodes for related tasks
combined_task = Task(description="Process and analyze data")
combined_node = Node(id="process_and_analyze", actor=DataActor(), task=combined_task)
```

### Use Conditional Edges Effectively

Leverage conditional edges to skip unnecessary nodes based on runtime conditions:

```python
def skip_condition(data):
    return data.get('skip_analysis', False)

graph.add_edge(Edge(source_id="data_collection", target_id="data_analysis", condition=lambda data: not skip_condition(data)))
graph.add_edge(Edge(source_id="data_collection", target_id="result_presentation", condition=skip_condition))
```

## Checkpointing and State Management

### Optimize Checkpoint Frequency

Balance checkpoint frequency with performance needs:

```python
graph = SmartGraph(checkpoint_frequency=10)  # Adjust based on your workflow complexity
```

### Implement Efficient State Serialization (Coming Soon)

In future versions, SmartGraph will support custom state serialization for more efficient checkpoint storage and loading.

## Profiling and Monitoring (Coming Soon)

Future versions of SmartGraph will include built-in profiling and monitoring tools.

## Best Practices for Performance

1. **Efficient Data Handling**: Minimize data transfer between nodes by passing only necessary information.
2. **Resource Management**: Close connections and free resources promptly after use.
3. **Caching**: Implement caching for expensive computations or frequently accessed data.
4. **Asynchronous I/O**: Use asynchronous libraries for I/O operations (e.g., aiohttp for HTTP requests, asyncpg for database operations).
5. **Regular Profiling**: Consistently profile your application to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

## Conclusion

Optimizing SmartGraph applications involves a combination of efficient task design, smart memory management, and thoughtful graph structure. As SmartGraph continues to evolve, more advanced performance features will become available, enabling even more powerful and efficient AI-driven workflows.
