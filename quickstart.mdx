## Creating a Graph

To create a graph, you'll use the `SmartGraph` class:

```python
from smartgraph import SmartGraph, Node, Edge, HumanActor, AIActor, Task

# Create a new graph
graph = SmartGraph()

# Create actors
human_actor = HumanActor("User")
ai_actor = AIActor("AI", assistant=your_assistant)

# Create nodes
start_node = Node("start", human_actor, Task(description="Start the conversation"))
ai_response_node = Node("ai_response", ai_actor, Task(description="AI response"))
human_feedback_node = Node("human_feedback", human_actor, Task(description="Human feedback"))

# Add nodes to the graph
graph.add_node(start_node)
graph.add_node(ai_response_node)
graph.add_node(human_feedback_node)

# Create and add edges
graph.add_edge(Edge(start_node.id, ai_response_node.id))
graph.add_edge(Edge(ai_response_node.id, human_feedback_node.id))
graph.add_edge(Edge(human_feedback_node.id, ai_response_node.id))
```

## Executing the Graph

To execute the graph:

```python
async def run_graph():
    final_output, should_exit = await graph.execute("start", {"initial_input": "Hello"}, "conversation_1")
    print("Final output:", final_output)
    print("Should exit:", should_exit)

import asyncio
asyncio.run(run_graph())
```

## Visualizing the Graph

You can visualize your graph using the `draw_graph` method:

```python
graph.draw_graph("my_graph.png")
```

This will save a visualization of your graph to "my_graph.png".

## Using Checkpoints

SmartGraph automatically manages checkpoints during execution. You can configure the checkpoint frequency when creating your SmartGraph instance:

```python
graph = SmartGraph(checkpoint_frequency=10)  # Save a checkpoint every 10 nodes
```

## Error Handling and Logging

SmartGraph provides robust error handling and logging capabilities. You can access the logger like this:

```python
from smartgraph.logging import SmartGraphLogger

logger = SmartGraphLogger.get_logger()
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
```

For more advanced usage and configuration options, please refer to the API documentation.
