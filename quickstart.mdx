Welcome to SmartGraph! This guide will help you set up your first SmartGraph application in just a few minutes. We'll create a simple AI assistant that can answer questions and perform web searches.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install SmartGraph">

First, let's install SmartGraph and its dependencies. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install smartgraph python-dotenv
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Your Environment">
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my_smartgraph_app
cd my_smartgraph_app
```

Create a new file called `.env` in this directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

 </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your First SmartGraph Application">
Create a new file called `app.py` and add the following code:

```python
import asyncio
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

from smartgraph import ReactiveSmartGraph
from smartgraph.components import CompletionComponent, TextInputHandler
from smartgraph.tools.duckduckgo_toolkit import DuckDuckGoToolkit

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

class SmartAssistant(ReactiveSmartGraph):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        pipeline = self.create_pipeline("Assistant")

        pipeline.add_component(TextInputHandler("Input"))
        pipeline.add_component(CompletionComponent(
            "AIAssistant",
            model="gpt-4o-mini",
            api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
            system_context="You are a helpful assistant that can answer questions and perform web searches when needed.",
            toolkits=[DuckDuckGoToolkit()]
        ))

        self.compile()

    async def ask(self, question: str):
        return await self.execute_and_await("Assistant", question)

async def main():
    assistant = SmartAssistant()

    while True:
        user_input = input("Ask me anything (or type 'exit' to quit): ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
            break

        response = await assistant.ask(user_input)
        print(f"Assistant: {response.get('ai_response', 'Sorry, I could not generate a response.')}")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

This script sets up a simple AI assistant that can answer questions and perform web searches when needed.

</Step>

<Step title="Run Your Application">

Now, let's run your SmartGraph application:

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see a prompt asking you to input a question. Try asking various questions, including some that might require a web search.

Example interaction:

```
Ask me anything (or type 'exit' to quit): What is the capital of France?
Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.

Ask me anything (or type 'exit' to quit): Who won the latest Nobel Prize in Literature?
Assistant: I'll need to search for the most up-to-date information on that. One moment please...

The latest Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Jon Fosse in 2023. Jon Fosse is a Norwegian author known for his minimalist style and work in various genres including novels, poetry, essays, children's books, and drama. He was awarded the prize "for his innovative plays and prose which give voice to the unsayable."

Ask me anything (or type 'exit' to quit): exit
```

  </Step>
</Steps>
