## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

Fork the SmartGraph repository to your GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository that you can freely experiment with.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command, replacing `<your-username>` with your GitHub username:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/smartgraph.git
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to the cloned repository directory and create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. We recommend using `poetry`:

```bash
cd smartgraph
poetry install
```

This will install all dependencies, including development dependencies.

### 4. Activate the Environment

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
poetry shell
```

### 5. Run Tests

Before making any changes, ensure that the existing tests pass. SmartGraph uses pytest for testing. Run the following command from the root directory of the project:

```bash
pytest
```

## Coding Conventions

- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- **Type Hints:** Use type hints for function parameters and return values to improve code clarity and maintainability.
- **Docstrings:** Write comprehensive docstrings for all classes, methods, and functions, following the Google style guide.
- **Meaningful Variable and Function Names:** Use descriptive and self-explanatory names for variables, functions, and classes.

## Making Changes

### 1. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

### 2. Implement Your Changes

Make the necessary code changes, ensuring to follow the coding conventions outlined above.

### 3. Write Tests

Write unit tests to cover your code changes. SmartGraph uses pytest for testing. Place your tests in the appropriate directory within the `tests` folder.

### 4. Run Tests

Run the tests to ensure that your changes haven't introduced any regressions:

```bash
pytest
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add my new feature"
```

### 6. Push Your Branch

Push your branch to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request

Create a pull request from your forked repository's branch to the `main` branch of the original SmartGraph repository. Provide a clear description of your changes and the problem they solve.

## Documentation

Documentation is crucial for the success of any open-source project. SmartGraph uses Markdown for documentation. Ensure that your code changes are accompanied by appropriate documentation updates.

## Review and Integration

Once you've submitted a pull request, the SmartGraph maintainers will review your code and provide feedback. Be prepared to address any comments or suggestions. Once the review process is complete and all tests pass, your changes will be merged into the main branch.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Please review our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for detailed information on how to contribute code, report bugs, and request new features. Remember to update the `pyproject.toml` file when adding new dependencies, and use `poetry` for managing your environment.
